      <p>
        My name is Luke, and I am a passionate, life long learner who does challenging things just for the fun of it. I
        love to push myself and others to meet their true potential. My goal is to make as big of an impact on the
        advancement in computer technology as I can.

          I spent my 2023 Summer (May-August 2023) working at Lincoln Electric Additive Solutions. We worked and learned
          aside industry professionals in mechanical, electrical, software, and welding engineering. We learned and went
          through the process of additive manufacturing all the way from producing a CAD model in SolidWorks to printing
          it with ABB IRB4600 robot. We also got to go through some weld training, but I mainly spent my time learning
          about their complex slicing software SculptPrint. The head of software took me through the process of
          completely building the software from scratch and working with the huge code base. I also learned OpenGL and
          got incite into how it was used to render 3D and 2D graphics in the software. As a final project, I created a
          Windows application with C++ and OpenGL to allow my co-intern to view a 3D representation of his .ply files by
          being able to zoom in and out, and pan around the model.</div>

          From June-September 2023, at Heinen's Grocery Store I cut and organized strawberries, pineapple, cantaloupe,
          watermelon, and honeydew, as well as lifted and dumped 50 pound boxes of oranges and grapefruits to prepare
          juice to sell. I completely took apart the juice machine to clean every inch in 4 steps and maintained the
          cleanliness of the area by mopping, scrubbing, and putting the cardboard in the baler. I also Labeled the date
          on everything produced and kept track of where it went and how much I made on paper for other coworkers
          convenience. Made peanut, almond, and cashew butter weekly, and took it to place out on the floor. Kept track
          of dates so I knew how long to keep the fruit I cut in the cooler, and figured out what days shipments came in
          so I would know what to work on. If I finished my objectives early, my job would be to scout the isles in
          produce to see what needed to be pulled forward/stocked. I had to memorize the layout of the entire cooler and
          backroom so I could find the products to put out myself. When I was out on the floor I also greeted customers
          and took them directly to where they wanted to go if they needed it; finishing up the day by taking down the
          required produce and storing it in the cooler, and sweeping up the floor around the produce area.

      <p>
        From August-November 2022, I Collaborated with a professor/NASA Astrophysicist at The Ohio State University to
        create a series of games using the Unity physics engine. The goal was to teach physics concepts such as
        kinematic equations to younger audience. The project was put on hold, but plans are in place to potentially fund
        the project in the future!
